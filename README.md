"# alexa-meditation-skill" 

" Inspiration: stopthinkbreathe.org is an excellent app and website for guided meditations. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could start them up 
" with your Amazon Echo?

" Purpose: To test out the alexa developer story, not for a fully functioning skill.
" This project is a sketch of the initial skills component: connecting Alexa responses to some light python responses.

" Issues:
" 1. the invocation phrase 'echo <start | ask | play | use > < skill name >' is very awkward and doesn't lend itself easily to this purpose
" e.g., 'echo start stop breathe think.... echo ask stop breathe think.... echo play stop breathe think'
"
" 2. stopthinkbreathe.org doesn't hav any public API or endpoint for authentication --> alt: do a web request with their 'just browsing' feature
"
" 3. streaming the meditation audio from stopthinkbreathe.org may be technically and legally challening.
" TODO: Reaching out to stopthinkbreathe.org or Tools For Peace (TFP) for permission.
